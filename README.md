# TABLEAU STAYCATIN

"As a Business Analyst at StayCatin.com, I played a pivotal role in harnessing data to drive strategic decisions for the company. Given access to data from this online property booking platform, similar to Airbnb, I was tasked with the creation of a dashboard to empower business management with actionable insights. This data encapsulated property details, customer reviews, and pricing dynamics over time.

I successfully designed a comprehensive dashboard that addressed key inquiries:

Identified and showcased the top 10 earning properties.
Uncovered the relationship between property prices and earnings.
Pinpointed high-earning shorefront locations.
Explored the connection between property prices and customer reviews.
